# Prediction of the sea level rise



The aim of this project was to study the sea level rise from 1998 to 2016 and to predict from these data the sea level in 2100.

The project was divided into 3 main parts:

    A first part of data visualization: trying to see if a rise in water level is observable
    In a second part, we tried to identify important relationships in ssh with principal components analysis (PCA).
    In the last part, we tried to predict the rise in ocean levels by means of different techniques (SVR, Regression, Neural Network,...)

This project is a cooperation between the students from IMT Atlantique and Ensta Bretagne (done in 2021). This project was realised by :

    Marceau Michel
    Mathieu Pierronne
    Vanessa Vandenberghe
    Wadia Ferjani
